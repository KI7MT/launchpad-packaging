Description: GUI based tool to compare two RTTY streams
 Comptext is used to compare two RTTY streams. It's comparison function uses
 a linear-programming technique. It computes total number of errors, the
 character error rate (CER) and the bit error rate (BER). Special attention is
 given to SHIFT and UNSHIFT to account for an error occuring in that character.
