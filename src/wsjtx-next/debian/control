Description: JT9 and JT65 Modes for LF, MF and HF Amateur Radio.
 WSJT-X implements JT9, a new mode designed especially for the LF, MF,
 and HF bands, as well as the popular mode JT65. Both modes were
 designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme
 weak-signal conditions. They use nearly identical message structure
 and source encoding. JT65 was designed for EME (“moonbounce”) on the
 VHF/UHF bands and has also proved very effective for worldwide QRP
 communication at HF; in contrast, JT9 is optimized for HF and lower
 frequencies. JT9 is about 2 dB more sensitive than JT65A while using
 less than 10% of the bandwidth. World-wide QSOs are possible with
 power levels of a few watts and compromise antennas. A 2 kHz slice
 of spectrum is essentially full when occupied by ten JT65 signals.
 As many as 100 JT9 signals can fit into the same space, without
 overlap.
 .
 WSJT-X offers a “bi-lingual“ operating mode in which you can transmit
 and receive JT65 and JT9 signals, switching between modes
 automatically as needed. Displayed bandwidth can be as large as 5
 kHz. If your receiver has as upper-sideband filter at least 4 kHz
 wide, you can have all the typical JT65 and JT9 activity on screen at
 once, available for making QSOs with a click of the mouse. Even with
 standard SSB-width IF filters, switching between JT65 and JT9 modes
 is quick and convenient. Be sure to read the online WSJT-X User's
 Guide.
